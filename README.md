<p>First, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/">Install Flask here</a></p>
<p>Then download the Minecraft server.jar file from <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/">here</a> and put it into the same directory as the main.py file</p>
<p>Then run the server, and change the false in the EULA to true</p>
<p>All set up! Just run main.py and it should work, with the http://localhost:5000/runserver and http://localhost:5000/getstatus</p>
